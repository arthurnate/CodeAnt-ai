PLEASE READ THE DESCRIPTION FIRST:
TO VISIT THE SIGNIN PAGE PLEASE USE : localhost:3000/signin
ROUTE!!!!
This product is strictly frontend-based and does not involve any backend integration. The routing and other interactions are handled using React.
Here are a few alternative suggestions that could have been implemented:

1. I did not notice the selection button in the hero section and the sign-in section; I mistook it for a different kind of button. As a result, I used two types of buttons: blue for the primary button and white for the secondary button.
2. There is a significant margin issue that occurs at medium to large screen sizes (1100-1400px). I tried various solutions, but I couldn't resolve it without rebuilding the component. To avoid complications, I decided to leave this error uncorrected. Other than that, there are no additional errors. I would appreciate the opportunity to learn from my mistakes and receive guidance on this matter.
3. The navbar section was intended to be fixed. However, after building the entire page, I did not make any changes to avoid further complications.
4. Grids could have been utilized in the hero section to prevent these errors, but that would have made the code appear lengthy and disorganized.

I acknowledge that there are a few mistakes, but I built this within a tight time frame due to the holiday season. I would be very grateful for the chance to learn from my errors, as highlighted above. I guarantee that every single line of code is hand-written; nothing is AI-generated or copied. I look forward to a positive response.

Thank you.
